# Mastering Bitcoin Cash

This is a React SPA web app that tracks an [SLP Group Token](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md) and displays the Non-Fungible Tokens (NTFs) tracked by that Group Token. This app is alive at [videos.cashstack.info](https://videos.cashstack.info/) and tracks a series of tokenize tutorial videos.

Because these videos are uploaded to multiple platforms, including IPFS, and linked in the NFT (on the blockchain). There is no effective way to censor them, or any effective way to deplatform me as a content creator. With this work, I'm hoping to inspire content creators to start publishing content in a censorship-resistant way.

These tokens can be sold on a decentralized exchange (DEX), which creates a direct connection between the content creator and their 'true fans'. The NFT allows the creator to communicate privately with the holder and to air-drop them gifts.
